I was fortunate enough to be invited to speak about Elixir, Telemetry, and Observability at Empex MTN on May 6th. I didn't realize how much I missed nerding out with people, in person. Getting to know more folks in the Elixir community was absolutely fantastic.

This was my first conference talk in a long time, close to 8 years. While I definitely stumbled a little bit, I had a lot of fun putting this talk together. I already have some more talk ideas brewing around in my head and can't wait to get back into speaking on a more regular basis.
